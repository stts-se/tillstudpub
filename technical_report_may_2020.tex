\section{Introduction}

In this document, we describe the background for some demo
applications using the web audio API for microphone recording in the
browser.  Different methods for recording in the browser and sending
the resulting audio to a server are listed below. 

There is audio processing built into the browser, and there is a
JavaScript web audio API (but the audio processing itself is probably not
implemented in JavaScript).

There are different ways to capture audio in the browser, and
different ways to transporting the audio to a server.

This document is accompanied by some example applications at
github.com/stts-se/tillstudpub. These consist of small client-server
examples, run in the browser, from wich the audio is sent to a server
and saved to disk. All examples work in recent versions of Chrome, but
may not work in other browsers.

Precompiled versions for Linux and Windows are
found at github.com/stts-se/tillstudpub/releases.


\begin{enumerate}
\item {\tt promptrec} presents the user with text to read aloud. The
  recordings are saved on the server.

\item {\tt audio\_streaming} streams microphone audio from the browser
  to a server. There are two competing methods, one
  using { \tt ScriptProcessorNode}, the other using {\tt
    AudioWorklet}, a more recent approch.

\item {\tt webrtc\_demo} is a sketchy example of using the WebRTC
  protocol for streaming audio to a server. Not a fully functioning
  application, and based on an example of the Pion WebRTC implementation.
  See pion.ly and github.com/pion.
  
\end{enumerate}




\section{Recording a complete file before sending to the server}

One way to do microphone recording in a web browser is using the
JavaScript Web Audio API to create an audio file in the browser. You
can obtain an audio stream from the microphone using the {\tt
  getUserMedia()} function. Using a {\tt MediaRecorder}, the audio can
be saved as a {\tt Blob}, ``a file-like object of immutable, raw
data'' \cite{blob}. When the recording is done, the {\tt Blob} can be
added to an HTML5 audio element, that can be played using the web
browser.

The audio file can be sent to a HTTP server (typically as a base64 encoded
string), and saved on the server.

The audio files might be of different encodings, depending on
the browser, so you need to pass his information on to the server
(unless you convert to a common format in the browser, but this may be
non-trivial).

This method works when the user wants to record something, and only
when done send it to the server. This could, for example, be a
recording tool, where you read aloud and record a manuscript sentence
presented in the browser, such as the current {\tt promprec} demo.

However, this method is not useful for streaming audio to the server.

\subsection*{Pros}
\begin{itemize}
\item The audio format is known
\item A complete audio file is created before sending it over the network
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Cons}
\begin{itemize}
\item The audio format cannot be changed (it is controlled by the browser)
\item Not for streaming
\end{itemize}


\section{Streaming using ScriptProcessorNode}

The ScriptProcessorNode\cite{scriptprocessornode} was introduced to meet developers' need to process audio streams in the Web Audio API. Unlike other parts of the Web Audio API, the processing is run in the main thread, which can cause delays. It has since been deprecated. More information on the motivation behind the move to AudioWorklet can be found in \cite{icmc}.

\subsection*{Pros}
\begin{itemize}
\item Supported by most browsers
\item \ldots
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Cons}
\begin{itemize}
\item Can have performance and quality issues
\item Deprecated
\end{itemize}


\section{Streaming using AudioWorklet}

The AudioWorklet was developed to handle some design flaws in the ScriptProcessorNode. The first implementation of the AudioWorklet was released 2018 for Chrome \cite{icmc}.

Unfortunately, the AudioWorklet is yet not fully supported by Firefox (neither stable version 75 nor beta version 76 work as of April 29th, 2020). According to the documentation, it should work with Firefox (stable) version 76. It works fine with Google Chrome (tested using version 81) and Opera (tested using version 68).


\subsection*{Pros}
\begin{itemize}
\item Processing run in a separate thread
\item Less latency than ScriptProcessorNode
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Cons}
\begin{itemize}
\item Not supported by all browsers (see \cite{audioworklet})
\item \ldots
\end{itemize}



\section{Streaming over a websocket}

A websocket can be thought of as a bi-directional HTTP
connection. Usually, when a client calls an HTTP server, there is a
request from the client, and a response from the server, and that's
it. Subsequent calls must establish new connections to the server.

A websocket, on the other hand, is an HTTP connection that may stay
open for any period of time, and on which both the client and the
server may send data. Since a websocket is an upgraded HTTP
connection, is has much of the same characteristics, such as
guarantees against package loss, etc.

After a websocket connection has been established, the
client and the server may send text or binary data to each other in
any form.

A difference between a websocket and a normal HTTP connection, is that
there is not a well defined protocol for interaction between client
and server (such as GET and POST, etc). You have to create your own
protocol. 


\section{Streaming using WebRTC}

WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) \cite{webrtc} is a peer-to-peer method for
streaming audio and video. In other words, you can use it to stream
audio and video directly between web-browsers (as long as there is
some way of the browsers to find each other, for example using a STUN
server).

WebRTC is build on UDP (rather than HTTP). The WebRCT uses the Opus
codec for audio (and V8 for video).

Since human cognition is more forgiving to missing samples than to
latency, as little lag as possible is more important than being sure
that the original sound wave is complete and intact --- packet loss is
tolerated. The original sound wave might not be possible to reproduce
on the other end. Since speech is full of redundant information and
human cognition is built for interpreting a noisy signal, this may not
be a big issue for understanding speech sent over a bad network using
WebRTC.

Under the hood, WebRTC takes care of things like echo-canceling and
noise reduction. 


WebRTC also includes a DataChannel API, that can be used for
transporting data without packet loss. However, a websocket may do the
job equally good, if you do not need peer-to-peer capabilities.

\subsection*{Pros}
\begin{itemize}
\item Supported by most browsers \cite{webrtcsupport}
\item \ldots
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Cons}
\begin{itemize}
\item Risk of packet loss
\item Little risk of latency
\item \ldots
\end{itemize}



\section{Browser settings for audio and streaming}

There seems to be some settings in the browser(s), that are difficult to control. Examples:

\begin{description}
\item[Sample rate] Can be retrived but not changed
\item[Channel count] We can set this value, but are not sure how it's used. The wav library currently used on the server side only supports mono.
\item[Audio encoding]\ \\[-14pt]
  \begin{description}
  \item[\em{AudioWorklet/ScriptProcessorNode}] For streaming, a browser's recording is by definition 32bit PCM. We have chosen to convert to 16bit PCM before sending to server.
  \item[\em{WebRTC}] OPUS
  \item[\em{ Non-streaming}] The browser controls the encoding, but the value can be retreived.
    
  \end{description}
